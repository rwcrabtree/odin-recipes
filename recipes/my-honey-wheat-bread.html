    <h1>My Honey Wheat Bread</h1>

    <h2>My Recipe</h2>
    <p>This dough recipe did not start out as my own. When 
        we were all stuck at home and things were crazy one
        thing I decided to focus a little time on was perfecting
        a "home made" bread recipe. Everyone in my family loves 
        bread and has a great respect for hand made food. Traditions
        that can be passed down.
    </p>
    <p>Thus the tradition began. I researched many recipes and 
        took time to read them all before trying a few. The one 
        I landed on is the one that got me closest to the recipe
        I'm detailing here. There are ingredients I've found you 
        can do without, also better ways to manage the yeast and 
        get a good bloom. This recipe has taken such center stage 
        in our family that I handed out several loafs as Christmas 
        gifts this past holiday season.
