    <h1>Fried Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Also, Everyone's Favorit</h2>
    <p>Similar to the pizza storyt, for a long time with the kids
        chicken nuggets were the go to if it wasn't pizza rolls 
        or pizza of some kind. Over time I figured out how to make 
        my own chicken nuggets, chunking up chicken breasts into
        nugget sized portions and breading them and frying them
        myself. This way I was sure what was in them and, they
        are just better.

    <h3>Ingreadients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breast</li>

        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Bread Crumbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together the milk and flour to thicken.</li>
        <li>Cut the chicken breast up into 1.5 inch cubes.</li>
        <li>Let the chicken breast cubes rest in the milk and 
            flour mix, season to taste.
        </li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, place 4-5 chicken chunks
            in with the bread crumbs and toss until covered. 
            You should be able to pick them out with your hands and
            not have a mess on your fingers.
        </li>
        <li>Start the oil heating in a shallow frying pan while
            finishing breading the chicken and allow the chicken to rest
            while the oil heats.
        </li>
        <li>Fry the chicken to a darkish golden brown, give them 
            space enough for the oil to bubble around them, not touching.
        </li>
        <li>Season afterwards.</li>
    </ol>
