    <h1>My Homemade Pizza</h1>

    <h2>Everyones Favorite</h2>
    <p>Everyone in my family loves pizza. For a long time
        it was all anyone would eat other than pizza rolls or Chicken
        nuggets. At first when my kids were young I would get 
        dough pouches and make everything from a box, not thinking much 
        about ingredients but as the kids got older I wanted something 
        different. I didn't like that it all came from a box
        and I wanted to perfect things a little so I found a good
        dough recipe and made everyones favorite that much better.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 packet platinum instant yeast 
            (2 1/4 teaspoon or 1/3 of a 2 ounce block 
            (so .66 ounces of cake yeast)</li>
        <li>~350 grams of water or 1 1/2 cups 
            * if using same day use warm water
            (105-115 degrees F/40-46 degrees C). 
            If fermenting overnight in the fridge 
            use cold water</li>
        <li>10 grams or 2 1/4 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>~475 grams or 3 – 3 1/2 cups 00 Pizza flour 
            or any high gluten bread flour, plus extra as needed</li>
        <li>8 grams (1.4 teaspoon) sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>If using Active Dry yeast, you need to proof 
            it first. Proof the yeast by pouring the yeast 
            into the water in a bowl of your stand mixer and 
            gently stir until the yeast dissolves. 
            *Cake yeast you make have to break up with your 
            fingers. If using Instant Yeast, you do not need 
            to proof it. Just add the water and yeast to the bowl 
            and skip to step 3.</li>
        <li>Let the yeast and water stand until foamy, about 
            5 minutes*. If using cold water, just mix and move 
            to the next step as the yeast won’t quite bloom 
            with cold water.</li>
        <li>Once the yeast has bloomed (if you’re using cake 
            or active dry yeast), add in the flour and fit your 
            mixer with a dough hook. Mix on low just until loosely 
            combined. Add in the salt while the mixer is running 
            stopping if need be to scrape down the sides. After 3
             minutes of mixing, drizzle in the oil.</li>
        <li>Mix until a soft, smooth elastic ball form; ~8-10 
            minutes. The dough should pull away from the sides 
            of the bowl but still be wet/tacky to the touch. If 
            need be add a tablespoon of flour or so to help combine. 
            If it’s too dry, you may need to add a few tablespoon 
            of water. Remove the dough from the bowl and place it 
            on a very lightly floured surface. Give it a few kneads 
            to form the dough into a smooth ball tucking the ‘ends’ 
            underneath.
        </li>
        <li>Allow the dough to rest, covered for 30 minutes. After
             30 minutes, using very lightly floured hands, knead 
             the dough gently by hand just to smooth it out and divide 
             into smaller portions.  If using the same day, divide 
             the dough in half, shape as balls, and put in 2 separate 
             bowls (covered) and allow to rise until doubled in size; 
             about 60-90 minutes. *If you’re placing in the fridge, 
             divide into 2 equal-sized balls, and place in 2 bowls 
             covered with plastic wrap (just be sure it has enough 
             room to rise) and refrigerate (covered) between 48-72 
             hours. The slow cold rise will help build the flavors. 
             *My personal favorite</li>
        <li>Place one rack on the lower third of your oven. On 
            that place a pizza stone.  It’s recommended you use 2
             when you bake pizza. Place another rack on the upper 
             ledge and place the 2nd pizza stone there. When ready 
             to use, preheat the oven to 550F. If you’ve had the 
             dough in the fridge, bring out to room temperature at 
             least an hour prior to baking. If you use a pizza stone, 
             follow the manufacturer’s instructions on heating that 
             up.</li>
        <li>Stretch out your dough on a very lightly floured surface 
            (trying not to work it too much as you want the ‘gas’ 
            left it in – that’s what causes the bubbles and crispy 
            airiness of the dough).</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a pizza pan, directly on a Pizza 
            Stone stone or on a Pizza Screen – whatever your 
            preferred method.</li>
        <li>Top with your favorite toppings and bake for 8-12 
            minutes depending on what you’re cooking it on.</li>
    </ol>
